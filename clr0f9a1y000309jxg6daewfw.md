Blockchain technologies as we know now were not designed to sustain massive amount of computation operations: they are slow and extremely costly for such scenarios. Yet for many practical applications meaningful and sometimes massive amount of computation operations are a must. During the presentation, we will discuss and demonstrate how holding blockchain promises of trustlessness and data immutability we can still implement computation-intensive applications.
